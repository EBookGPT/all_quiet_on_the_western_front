This is a story that has the potential to be gripping, but it needs a serious overhaul.  You're telling us *about* the war, instead of *showing* it.  Let's dive into specific problems and how to fix them:

**1.  The "Show, Don't Tell"  Sin:**

* **Chapter 1:**  You spend pages describing Stadelheim and the boys' pre-war lives. This is all "telling," not "showing."  Instead of saying "the scent of freshly baked bread hung heavy in the air," describe a specific bakery, the smell of warm dough, the sight of loaves being pulled from the oven.  Show us the boys playing football, not just tell us they are.

* **Chapter 2:** "The landscape was a vast, desolate expanse, dominated by endless lines of trenches, mud, barbed wire, and the constant threat of shelling." This is purely descriptive and lacks any sensory detail or emotional impact. Imagine a character stumbling through a trench, their boots sinking into the mud, the stench of rotting flesh filling their nostrils, the constant thud of artillery fire in the distance. This is how you show the horror of war.

**2.  Lackluster Dialogue:**

* **Chapter 1:**  Mr. Kantorek's "call to arms" speech is all exposition and zero character.  Give him a voice, a rhythm, an attitude.  Have the boys respond to his words, not just passively accept them.  Show their reactions, their doubts, their anxieties. 

* **Chapter 2:**  We get descriptions of Katczinsky, MÃ¼ller, Kropp, etc., but no actual interaction between them.  What do they talk about?  How do they argue?  What are their hopes and fears?  Dialogue reveals character and advances the story.

**3.  Weak Narrative:**

* **Overall:** The story feels like a report, not a narrative.  We're being told what happened, not feeling the journey.  Instead of saying "they were packed like sardines in cattle cars," describe the cramped space, the smell, the claustrophobia, the sense of fear as the train rattles towards the unknown.  Show the characters' reactions to the sights and sounds of the front.

**4.  The "Heroic" Narrative:**

* **Chapter 1:** You perpetuate the myth of war as a noble adventure. This needs to be challenged.  Show the boys' naivete and how quickly it is shattered.  Instead of "eager to prove themselves," show their fear, their confusion, their desperate clinging to the familiar.

**5.  The "We"  Problem:**

* **Overall:** The story is narrated from a "we" perspective, which makes it impersonal and distant.  Choose one character, Paul, and tell the story through his eyes.  This will create a sense of intimacy and immediacy.  

**In Conclusion:**

Your story has the makings of something powerful, but it needs a complete rewrite.  Instead of telling us about war,  show us the fear, the pain, the exhaustion, the brutality, and the human cost.  Make the reader feel the weight of each moment, each loss, each act of violence.  Focus on character interactions, create believable dialogue, and most importantly, show the reader, don't just tell them.
